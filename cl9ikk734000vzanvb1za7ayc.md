# New and Improved Xamarin Studio Launcher

**UPDATE â€“ Nov 29, 2016:** By popular demand, Iâ€™ve created an update which is compatible with both Xamarin Studio and Visual Studio for Mac. Â Itâ€™s now called MS Solution Launcher and can be found on GitHub (source code and binary release).

Go Check out [MS Solution Launcher on GitHub](https://github.com/Redth/MSSolutionLauncher)!

**UPDATE â€“ Sep 27, 2016:**Â  Thereâ€™s a new version that I had forgotten to share from some time back which works with the newer versions of Xamarin Studio. Â Enjoy the updated download link at the bottom of the post ðŸ™‚

**UPDATE â€“ Jan 12, 2015:** Thanks to the wonderful [@Vaclav](http://twitter.com/vancura), Xamarin Studio Launcher now has a proper icon! Please download the much prettier v4 at the end of this post!

Awhile back I made a quick little AppleScript based app called [Xamarin Studio Launcher](http://redth.info/Xamarin-Studio-Launcher/) to help launch multiple instances of Xamarin Studio (it had a pretty little icon that you could keep in your dock to open new instances â€“ which I recently updated to the newer Xamarin look).

While it was cute, and relatively functional, as a recovering ex-Windows user, I found myself still constantly opening `.sln` files from finder, which would cause them to open in an existing instance of Xamarin Studio, closing whatever current solution happened to be open in that instance.

Now I know about the ability to open multiple solutions in the same Xamarin Studio instance, and generally Iâ€™m pretty good about forcing myself into learning the nuances of the platform Iâ€™m working on, however, having multiple instances of Visual Studio open was something I grew so accustomed to that I just couldnâ€™t shake the habit of being on a Mac!

Not sure why it took me so long to make this, but here it is, finally!

Xamarin Studio Launcher v3
--------------------------

This new launcher app works first and foremost exactly like the [previous Xamarin Studio Launcher](https://redth.codes/Xamarin-Studio-Launcher/) I released. You can put it in your dock, and when you open it, it will launch a new, blank instance of Xamarin Studio.

_The new feature_ is that it can now handle opening `.sln` files. If you choose to open a `.sln` file with this app, it will open that `.sln` file in a _new_ instance of Xamarin Studio.

This means you can set Finder to open all `.sln` files with Xamarin Studio Launcher so any time you double click or otherwise open a `.sln` file from Finder, it will open in its own instance of Xamarin Studio!

**How to set this as the default app for .sln files**

![Finder Change All](https://cdn.hashnode.com/res/hashnode/image/upload/v1666361409984/-cAgCry6Y.png)

3.  Under the _Open With_ section, click the drop-down list and click _Choose_
4.  Navigate to and select _Xamarin Studio Launcher_
