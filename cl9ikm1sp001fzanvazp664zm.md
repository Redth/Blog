The Back Story
--------------

Way back in Froyo days, I took the leap from my iPhone 3G to Android as my daily device with a Samsung Galaxy S. I was co-authoring a book **[Professional Android Development with Mono and C#/.NET](http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/1118026438/ref=as_li_qf_sp_asin_tl?ie=UTF8&camp=1789&creative=9325&creativeASIN=1118026438&linkCode=as2&tag=red082-20)**

Android was new, it was exciting, it was _different_. It was also slower, higher maintenance, and had me flashing roms weekly. Not necessarily a problem for a supergeek like me, but still tiresome and prone to moments of _Oh sorry, thatâ€™s a bug in my phoneâ€™s rom_ or _my batteryâ€™s dead because of all the services i have running_.

Needless to say, it wasnâ€™t very long before I was back on the iPhone train. I was content with the iPhone 4, and then the iPhone 4S, and now the iPhone 5. Theyâ€™re all great devices, they just workâ€¦ as long as you want to use them how Apple intends.

The primary reasn Iâ€™m switching back to Android, is my Galaxy S just doesnâ€™t cut it for development anymore. My wonderful wife will inherit my iPhone 5 (like she does all my devices), and Iâ€™ll have a Nexus 4 to test on soon.

Why Iâ€™m looking forward to Android
----------------------------------

I have a Nexus 7. Itâ€™s quite nice. I like it better than the iPad, with the exception of a lack of apps in some areas (games). Android 4.2, I feel, finally starts to get things right. Sure thereâ€™s still issues, but by and large itâ€™s a good operating system. The eco-system is also quite mature now. Most, if not all the apps I use daily on iOS (which seems to be less nowadays) all exist in a reasonably good form on Android (save for maybe a really good Twitter client, but thatâ€™s something Iâ€™m currently working to fix!).

Iâ€™m getting excited for Android. See, the iPhone was great, but there are a lot of _compromises_ Iâ€™ve had to make to be a happy iOS user. When I think about the things that bug me with iOS, Android largely has them right:

1.  **Gmail:** Ok, Google _JUST_ released a better Gmail app for iOS again. They actually did this just after I ordered my Nexus 4. Itâ€™s much better, however itâ€™s still not as awesome as Gmail on Android.
2.  **Default Apps:** Chrome, Gmail, Google Maps, all great apps and services. But on iOS, I canâ€™t choose to have links open in Chrome, I canâ€™t choose Gmail as my default mail client, nor can I have Google Maps default for navigation. I love that on Android I can finally do these things.
3.  **LockScreen Patterns:** I have a confession: Iâ€™ve not got any passcode set on my iPhone. I hate typing in passwords every time I want to unlock my screen. One thing I loved on Android was the pattern unlock. It felt much quicker, more intuitive, just easier. Iâ€™m happy to get back some security with little pain!
4.  **Lockscreen Widgets:** This is a pet peave of mine on iOS. At least notifications show up now, but I want to be able to see a bit more information so I can glance at the lockscreen and decide if I should open my phone or not. This is welcomed in android!
5.  **Notification Bar:** Google invented the notification bar. Itâ€™s way better than iOSâ€™s. I love how it shows a small icon in the status bar at the top of the screen, alluding to there being more notifications. I also like how rich notifications can be in Android, and that I can swipe individual ones away, or clear the whole lot of them. Itâ€™s just a much better implementation.
6.  **Google Now:** Siri is great, but Google Now seems more well thought out. Since I already use gmail, Iâ€™m looking forward to getting _cards_ with shipping status of things Iâ€™ve ordered, or [boarding passes](http://venturebeat.com/2012/12/05/google-now-boarding-pass/ "boarding passes"), automatically, without me telling it. This is a great system that surely requires some tweaking yet, but the idea that Google can give me the information I want when I need it, without me asking for it is awesome!
7.  **Google Maps:** Just like Gmail, google _JUST_ released a maps app for the iPhone. Itâ€™s actually really, really good! I am however, still looking forward to being able to cache some areas offline, and having Google Maps used as the _default_ navigation app on my OS.
8.  **No Lightning:** I still have only one lightning cable, partially because theyâ€™re hard to find, and partially because I HATE spending $20 on a usb cable. I do love that the cable is reversable, but itâ€™s not compelling enough for me not to be excited about having an endless supply of charging cables again ðŸ™‚

What Iâ€™ll Miss

Letâ€™s be honest. Thereâ€™s some things iOS just does right. Iâ€™ll no doubt miss several things about my iPhone, but I think weâ€™re finally at the stage the things I miss on Android are greater than those I miss on iPhone:

1.  **Apps!** Yeah, the Android ecosystem is WAY better than back in Froyo days, but iPhone still wins when it comes to games, and just sheer quantity of _quality_ apps. Iâ€™ll miss this, though not as much as I would have years ago.
2.  **Fit & Finish:** iPhone is a very polished OS. Thereâ€™s no denying this. Android has made strides to improve the _**butter**_yness of the interface, but iPhone is still king for that polished feeling.
3.  **Siri:** One thing I already know google now canâ€™t do is create reminders for a future day. Iâ€™m sure this will get added at some point, but itâ€™s one thing I use a lot with Siri right now, and Iâ€™m going to miss it!
4.  **Airplay:** This is actually the big thing Iâ€™m going to miss. I have two Apple TVâ€™s, and while I donâ€™t use it a lot, Airplay screen mirroring is incredibly useful when I do want it. Android just doesnâ€™t do this, and thereâ€™s no silver bullet in sight. I guess Iâ€™ll have to pull out the iPad when I want to do this! At least I can still control my iTunes remotely on Android and have it play to my AppleTV!

Whatâ€™s Next?
------------

Itâ€™s hard to say whether Iâ€™ll love Android, or find some of the same things annoying that caused me to switch back to iPhone. Iâ€™m sure there will be some remorse at times, but I think overall, Iâ€™ll really enjoy being back on Android for all the right reasons. Plus, now I can finally stop having people ask me why I use an iPhone once they find out I helped write [a book on Android programming](http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/1118026438/ref=as_li_qf_sp_asin_tl?ie=UTF8&camp=1789&creative=9325&creativeASIN=1118026438&linkCode=as2&tag=red082-20 "a book on Android programming")! Stay tuned, Iâ€™ll be posting again after using my Nexus 4 for awhile to see how itâ€™s going!
