# Xamarin Evolve 2013

Xamarin Evolve 2013 was an Awesome conference! I got to see a lot of familiar faces, and meet plenty of new ones! It’s such a great experience to see and talk with such great people who I’d only otherwise know online!

I also had the great privilege to do some speaking at Evolve! I’ve posted my slides below and will update the post with links to the videos when they are available!

Thanks to Xamarin and everyone who made this such a great event!
