# MobiDevDay Detroit 2013

Had a great turnout and lots of solid questions at my talk on Xamarin and C# at [Detroit MobiDevDay 2013](http://mobidevdaydetroit.com). I’ve got my slides posted for anyone who cares to have a look!

Thanks to [@MobiDevDay](http://twitter.com/@MobiDevDay) for having me, and to all those who came out!

MobiDevDay Detorit – Native Cross Platform Mobile with Xamarin and C
--------------------------------------------------------------------

Create iOS, Android, Mac, and Windows Phone apps in C#. Reuse code, and leverage existing .NET libraries and frameworks, while applying the same C# skillset everywhere to create truly native apps across mobile platforms. This session looks at why you’ll love using Xamarin’s popular mobile development tools to create native applications to increase productivity, while creating a first class native user experience across the most popular mobile platforms. This isn’t your grandmother’s hybrid web app, this is real native, platform API’s, and raw power.
